Managing Kernels and Terminals
==============================

The Running panel in the left sidebar shows a list of all the kernels and
terminals currently running across all notebooks, code consoles, and
directories:

   Alt text is intentionally left blank because the image content is described directly prior.

.. _reopen-document:

As with the classic Jupyter Notebook, when you close a notebook
document, code console, or terminal, the underlying kernel or terminal
running on the server continues to run. This enables you to perform
long-running actions and return later. The Running panel enables you to
re-open or focus the document linked to a given kernel or terminal:

  </div>

The recently closed and currently open documents can be searched in the
modal view, which can be opened using a keyboard shortcut,
or by clicking the [â†—] icon in the running sidebar.
