# @jupyterlab/rendermime

A JupyterLab package which manages mime bundle renderers for the application,
and provides default renderers for a number of formats, such as markdown,
HTML, images, and LaTeX.

A simplified interface for adding new mime renderers to the application
can be found in [@jupyterlab/rendermime-interfaces](../rendermime-interfaces).

The rendermime is a singleton on the [application](../application).
