# @jupyterlab/console

A JupyterLab package which implements an interactive console for Jupyter kernels.
It is designed to be similar to the [Jupyter QtConsole](https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole),
and can act as a more temporary scratch space for computation using the [notebook](../notebook)
and the [file editor](../fileeditor).
