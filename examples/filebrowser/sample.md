Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      | Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ---: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | 1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
