# files that match any pattern from .cleanignore are NOT removed by
# the `jlpm clean:slate` command. Same syntax as .gitignore (plus the @).
#
# @: if a pattern starts with "@", some includes are automatically added,
# in addition to the base exclude pattern. For example:
#
# @*.foo
#
# will add:
#
# *.foo
# !packages/**/*.foo
# !**/node_modules/**/*.foo
#
# These help ensure that all node_modules dirs are cleaned and that
# sibling installs of labextensions are not cleaned.
